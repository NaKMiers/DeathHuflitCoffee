                            Death Wish Coffee has harnessed robusta's magical powers since 2012, 
                            before other coffee companies caught on to its resistance to climate change and ability to brew a bold cup. 
                            We're bold enough to find the best qualities in robusta and give these power-packed beans proper care through processing at origin and roasting at our manufacturing sites.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <br>

                            This rigorous process results in a strong cup of coffee with increased aroma and mouth feel, 
                            low acidity, and an extra kick of caffeine. Paired with our Fair Trade and organic arabica beans,
                             you're guaranteed a bold, smooth and premium cup of coffee every timeâ€”because who wants weak, 
                             watery coffee?
